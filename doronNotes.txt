Application logic
    What happens if the user enters text instead of a number for game or difficulty selection? This triggers an error. There are ways to validate this without risking an error.
    Does the game conclude after a single playthrough? Perhaps inquire whether the user wishes to play again.
    The functions "start_play" and "welcome" should not return nothing.
Games
    In the currency conversion game, I recommend avoiding the use of APIs; there are libraries available for this purpose. - Done
